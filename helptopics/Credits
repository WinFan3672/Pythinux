# Credits

* Pythinux versions 1, 2, and 3 were developed solely by WinFan3672.  
* The icons present in Pythinux 3's programs are from Project Clarity v12.
* Pythinux relies on the following dependencies:  
	- PyQt5, a subset of the Qt toolkit. 
	- toml, a toml parsing library
	- pyqtdarktheme, a flat and dark theme for PyQt.
	- markdown, a markdown parser.
	
* Pythinux was developed using Python, a free-and-open-source programming language written partially in C and Python. 
* WinFan3672 uses Kate as a text editor.
