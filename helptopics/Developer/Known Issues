# Known Issues
* Terminal does not show text while the command is running.
    - This issue has been somewhat resolved.
* GUI programs cannot access the current window manager, and can only create a new one.
    - This is an architectural issue that would need an OS rewrite to fix. Because it's not major, I won't fix it.
* Incrementing the Binary Tally while locking integer overflow causes overflow anyway. 
    - I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CAUSES THIS ISSUE.
* The `ssh` command is broken. Of course it is.
* All windows in the window manager run in the same process.
	- This means that one program can crash the entire OS.
	- I have attempted to fix this, but have not been able to.
