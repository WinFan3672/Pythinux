# How To Get Help
If you require assistance with something, there are several ways of doing so.

## 1. Help Topics
Check through the help topics and see if the issue has been documented.
## 2. Manpages
There are several built-in manpages. Open a terminal emulator and run the `man` command. You can read manpages in a similar way to help topics.
## 3. GitHub
You can access the GitHub (https://github.com/WinFan3672/Pythinux/) and make an issue or pull request. A community member (or several) will respond to you.
